## Loading and preprocessing the data


# Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Load the data
activity_data <- read.csv("activity.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")

# Check the structure of the data
str(activity_data)

# Convert 'date' column to Date format
activity_data$date <- as.Date(activity_data$date, "%Y-%m-%d")

# Summarize missing values
sum(is.na(activity_data))



## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

# Remove rows with missing values (NA)

## Imputing missing values

# Calculate the total number of missing values

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
